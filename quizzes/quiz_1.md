# SEI Week 1 Quiz

### Please slack your instructors the answers, in numbered order. Do not include the questions. For example:
```
1. Hello
2. World
```

### Don't forget to use a `const` or `let` when defining new variables...

## Bash/Zsh (Terminal)

#### For EACH question in this section, assume you are in the `~/fridge` directory and answer with what terminal commands(s) will perform the following...

1. Make a `vegetables` and a `cakes` directories inside of `~/fridge`.

2. Create two files, `onion.txt` and `lettuce.txt`, within the new `vegetables` directory.

3. Delete the `vegetables` directory (and everything inside it).

## JS Variables

4. Assign the string "SEI" to a variable named `course`.

## Data Structures - JS Arrays

5. Define an array named `weekend` with just the string 'Saturday' in it.

6. Write the line of code that will add the string 'Sunday' to the end of the `weekend` array.

7. Knowing that the `weekend` array now contains the string 'Saturday' followed by the string 'Sunday', write the line of code that will assign the 'Saturday' string to a variable named `day`.

## Data Structures - JS Objects

8. Assign an object literal to a variable named `brain` having a property with a key of `energyLevel` and a numeric value of `10`.

## JS Functions

9. Write a function declaration named `computeArea` that has two parameters, `length` & `width`, and **returns** the area of a rectangle (the `length` multiplied by the `width`).

## JS Control Flow

```js
// Car and trip data
let milesPerGallon = 25;
let gallonsLeft = 3;
let milesToGo = 100;
```

10. Write an `if` statement that uses all three of the above variables in its conditional expression and will `console.log('SOS!')` if the "car" does not have enough gallons of gas to travel at least the number of `milesToGo` (no need to write a function, just the `if` statement please).
